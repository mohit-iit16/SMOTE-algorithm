# SMOTE-algorithm
SMOTE algorithm for creating synthetic data to avoid data imbalance
A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally rep- resented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples.
A combination of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance
